- `index.html`: The home page of my website.
- `about.html`: The about page containing my personal information and interests.
- `portfolio.html`: The portfolio page showcasing my projects.
- `contact.html`: The contact page with a form for users to get in touch with me.
- `css/styles.css`: Contains all the CSS styles for my website.
- `assets/images/`: Contains images used on my website.
- `assets/screenshots/`: Contains screenshots of my projects for the portfolio page.

## Home Page

The home page (`index.html`) serves as the first impression of my website. I've included a photo, my mission statement, and a quote that defines me.

## About Page

The about page (`about.html`) allows visitors to get to know me better. I've included information about my interests, skills, and a brief introduction to give potential employers an insight into who I am.

## Portfolio Page

The portfolio page (`portfolio.html`) showcases my work. For each project, I've included the project name, a brief description, a screenshot, and a link to where the project lives on the web.

## Contact Page

The contact page (`contact.html`) provides a way for users to get in touch with me. I've included a contact form with fields such as name, email, subject, and message. I can add any additional fields as needed.

**Note**: The contact form may not be functional in this version of the project, but I plan to integrate it with a server-side script or a third-party service to process form submissions in the future.

I hope you enjoy exploring my personal website! I will continue to update the content and styles as I learn new techniques and make sure to keep my GitHub repository up to date.
